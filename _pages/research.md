# Research

We are exploring chemistry under extreme conditions of high pressure in GPa range (1 GPa = 10,000 bar) in combination with extreme chemical reactivity displayed by fluorine chemistry.

(Page under construction...)

### Noble-Gas Chemistry
We explore XeF<sub>2</sub> and KrF<sub>2</sub> coordination complexes and Lewis acid-base adducts.

### Fluorinated Materials
We work on fluorinated materials for batteries.

### Frustrated Magnetism and Superconductivity
We are interested in novel materials displaying exotic magnetic properties or supeconductivity.
