# Open positions

We are looking for new enthusiastic group members!



### Current open positions

- A fully funded 4-year Ph.D. studentship to work on an ERC project focusing on the high-pressure fluorine chemistry research.

The research will involve the use of custom-built vacuum lines, gloveboxes, low-temperature synthesis techniques, and diamond anvil cells. Novel compounds will be characterized primarily by X-ray diffraction (single-crystal, powder), and vibrational spectroscopy (Raman, ATR-FTIR). The candidate will receive hands-on training to acquire and master the skills required to work with reactive and unstable chemical species.
